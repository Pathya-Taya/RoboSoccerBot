2 L298 driver module: For controlling the stepper motors.
1 12V(1700 mAh) Battery: For powering the motors.
2 9V Battery: For powering arduinos and HC-12 modules.
2 Arduino Uno: One for car and one for remote.
Joystick: For remote
Metal Chassis, Wheels, Glue gun etc.
(Optional) Breadboard and BreadBoard Powersupply: For stable 5v in HC-12 module.
(A servo motor can also be added for shooting mechanism but that wasn't allowed in the competition)
